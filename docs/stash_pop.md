# About gits stash pop
The `git stash pop` command in Git combines the functionality of both `git stash apply` and `git stash drop`. When you use `git stash pop`, Git applies the changes from the most recent stash to your working directory, just like `git stash apply`. However, it goes a step further by removing the applied stash from the stash list, effectively dropping it. This command streamlines the process of applying stashed changes and cleaning up the stash list in a single step. It is particularly convenient when you're confident that you no longer need the stashed changes and want to seamlessly reintegrate them into your working directory while automatically discarding the stash reference. Similar to `git stash apply`, `git stash pop` is executed in the context of the current branch, ensuring that the stashed changes are appropriately merged into your codebase.

# Location of Code
The code that implements the abovementioned gits functionality is located [here](https://github.com/amoghmahesh14/GITS/blob/master/code/gits_stash_pop.py).

# Code Description
The gits stash pop applies the top most available stash on the stack to the current working branch and simulataneously drops the stash that is applied. If there is an error while applying and dropping the stash it is displayed to the user, so that it can be resolved.

## Functions
1. gits_stash_pop(args):
The `gits_stash_pop` function is a Python script that simplifies Git stash application and drop management. It allows users to readily apply their latest stashed changes and drop the corresponding stash tp simplify their work process.

# How to run it? (Small Example)
Use the command in following way to apply your stashed changes.
```
$ gits stash_pop
